				<h2>Military Base Living is Awesome</h2>

				<p> 
				Although my parents were in the Navy, my family was stationed on an Army base, Fort Dix, New Jersey.<br/> 
				I lived there from the age of 7 through 12; which is why I think I liked it so much.<br/>
				The population of Fort Dix is around 7,000, and the entire livingvside of the base was desgined<br/>
				to be as perfect as possible. They had playgrounds on every block, they were exactly the same, <br/>
				but you could see one jungle gym if you stood on top of another one. the houses were exactly the same as well.<br/>
				I still have dreams about it. There were always kids around my age though. I have friends that are all over the <br/>
				United States now. Being a military base, it was so safe you could play roller hockey in the street<br/>
				and stay out well past dark and not have a worry.

				<h2>1-2 Hour Commute to: New York, Philadelphia, THE OCEAN</h2>

				<p>
				I think this is pretty self explianitory(sp?). I love the ocean so very much and I miss it a lot. The water is suprisingly cold on the<br/>
				east coast, but it's managable(sp?) at least some of the year. Philadelphia is a little farther away, and i don't remember much about the city<br/>
				but I do remember Hersey Park. I love candy so obviously the park is going to stick out in my memory, but the whole town (named Hersey)<br/>
				was truly magical. They maintained thier old buildings so well, they are still standing beautifully today. The street lamps are shaped like<br/>
				Herseys Kisses and the chocolate factory is right next to the park, so you can smell chocolate as you enter the park. New York was my favorite<br/>
				city though. I have never been to a city like it, so many different people and things going on. It's amazing how you can stand in Times Square and<br/>
				be around more people than you could ever be comfortable with.

				<h2>Snow</h2>

				<p>
				We had to much snow in New Jersey. There was one year where a snow drift got so deep on base that all te dads packed it down and made <br/>
				a tunnel system/maze all through it. I remember making igloos, snow forts with compartments for snow balls and having two or three snow <br/>
				days in a row. There was a rule set in place, the school could add on a day at the end of the year for every snow day we got. After five days<br/>
				though, the snow days were deemed "Acts of God" and the school could no longer add days to the end of the school year. You can imagine how excited <br/>
				we were when we got more than five snow days. Which happened almost every year I lived there.
